This summer, I visited a variety of public lands in Colorado, learning about stewardship, conservation, and land management. From national parks and forests to state parks to state-managed river access, I was struck by the lack of information about accessible outdoor opportunities for people with disabilities. After doing research on the San Juan National Forest, I realized that there were significant problems in both access itself (limited opportunities for recreation) and lack of information (websites have limited information about accessibility of not just the campsites themselves, but also amenities such as toilets, water sources, parking, docks, visitor centers, and more). 

In this data project, I would like to pull either the raw visitor use data from the Manistee National Forest or use my own gathered from Manistee National Forest site visits to see which, if any, accessible recreation opportunities exist for people with disabilities and, if possible, compare that to various user statistics (such as need as indicated by survey and/or satisfaction). 

<h2>Why are you interested in this topic:</h2>

I work with people who have disabilities. As I transition from healthcare to natural resource management, I would like to use my specialized knowledge to help broad public lands access to all groups of people. 


<h2>How you will analyze said dataset:</h2>

My request for raw data from the Forest Service is still pending, so I’m not sure yet! (I don’t know what the data actually are yet.) 

In the event that I don’t get USFS data in time, I will use my own data. I will compare Manistee National Forest campsite, trail, restroom, and water source accessibility to ADA specifications, Michigan census data on people with disabilities, and use/satisfaction statistics if available. 

<h2>Stretch goal:</h2>

I’m  interested in creating a free public resource to share this information for people with disabilities who are looking for practical insights into which campsites, where, are disability-friendly. San Juan National Forest data has been analyzed, Manistee is next, and I will continue to explore other national forests. It only makes sense to make that work available to the folks who would most benefit from it.
